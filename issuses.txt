As a user, I want to mark a TODO as done on my TODOS list page so that I can track my progress.

 [c] In forms.py, create form for marking a TODO as done.
 [] Render the form on its own template at its own URL

 As a user, from my list of TODOS, I want to be able to use a form to add a new TODO, so that I can keep up with my responsibilities.

[c]  Add forms.py and form for adding a TODO
[c]  Display the form on the individual list page (if built, if not build a new page for the form).

As a User, I'd like to see all TODOS organized by their owner on the homepage, so that I can see what my family/team/organization is up to.

[c]  Separate TODOS by user
[]  Render the separated TODOS in an appealing way

As a User, I want to see an appealing interface, so that I enjoy using the app.

As a user, I want to be able to visit a page to see the TODOS I own, so that I can track my progress.
